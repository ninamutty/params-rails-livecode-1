They are reportedly worried that the high volume of players can potentially damage the protected dunes surrounding the area. “[We] want to ban these small virtual animals in protected areas and in the streets from 11:00 pm to 7:00 am,” the municipality said in a statement. “We had no other choice [but to go to court]. Kijkduin will remain an attractive place for Pokémon hunters, but there will be less trouble for the residents and the damage to protected areas will be limited.” According to The Guardian, the case will be heard before the court in the Hague on October 11."
